I am a Professor in the School of Mathematics at Sun Yat-sen University. I was an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at UMass Amherst. Before that, I was a postdoctoral fellow supervised by Professor Kosuke Imai, in the Department of Statistics and Department of Government at Harvard University, and in the Center for Statistics and Machine Learning and Department of Politics at Princeton University. I obtained my Ph.D. degree at Peking University, under the supervision of Professor Zhi Geng. I was a visiting student of Professor Tyler VanderWeele at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in 2013. 

My main interests are causal inference methodologies and contaminated data problems with applications in biomedical sciences and social sciences. I currently serve as the Associate Editor of *The Annals of Applied Statistics*.

### Research Interests
My research mainly focuses on causal inference.  
  
- Randomization-based analysis of experiments
- Observational studies with unmeasured confounding
     - instrumental variable approaches
     - sensitivity analysis
     - natural experiments
- Post-treatment variable adjustment: 
       - principal stratification: non-compliance, surrogate, truncation-by-death
       - mediation
- Complex data structure
      - point process data
      - spatio-temporal data
      - network data
- Measurement error and misclassification  
- Missing data: non-ignorable missing data mechanisms
